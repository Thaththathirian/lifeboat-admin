# Enhanced Payment Allotment System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the enhanced payment allotment system that allows admins to manage student payments, track transactions, and map donors to payments.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Student Selection with Status Display
- **Feature**: Admin can select students from a table that displays student status
- **Implementation**: 
  - Students are loaded from the API with their current status
  - Status is displayed using colored badges
  - Filtering by status is available
  - Sorting by name, college, and status

### 2. College Fee and Allotted Payment Display
- **Feature**: Display college fee for each student and last allotted payment amount
- **Implementation**:
  - `collegeFee` field added to Student interface
  - `lastAllottedAmount` field added to Student interface
  - Both values are displayed in the student table
  - College fee is randomly generated for demo purposes

### 3. Editable Amount Input with Prefilling
- **Feature**: Amount input is editable and prefilled with last allotted amount
- **Implementation**:
  - Amount input is disabled until student is selected
  - Prefilled with `lastAllottedAmount` from student data
  - Admin can modify the amount as needed
  - Amount is stored per student in `studentAmounts` state

### 4. Status Changes Dropdown
- **Feature**: Admin can change student status directly from the payment allotment interface
- **Implementation**:
  - Status dropdown with options: Payment Pending, Paid, Payment Verified
  - Status changes are tracked in `studentStatuses` state
  - Status updates are applied when payment is allotted

### 5. Payment Allotment Process
- **Feature**: When admin clicks "Allot Payment", selected students' status updates to "Payment Pending"
- **Implementation**:
  - Creates `PaymentAllotment` records for selected students
  - Updates student status to `PAYMENT_PENDING`
  - Stores allotment data with college fee, allotted amount, and status
  - Shows confirmation dialog with selected students and amounts

### 6. Transaction ID Generation
- **Feature**: When admin updates status to "Paid", transaction IDs are automatically generated
- **Implementation**:
  - `generateTransactionId()` function creates unique transaction IDs
  - Format: `TXN-{timestamp}-{randomString}`
  - Multiple transaction IDs can be generated for multiple status changes
  - Transaction records are created with student details and amount

### 7. Payment Mapping System
- **Feature**: Admin can select donors and map them to transactions
- **Implementation**:
  - Two-panel interface: Donors on left, Transactions on right
  - Admin selects donors from available donors table
  - Admin selects transactions from available transactions table
  - Creates `PaymentMapping` records linking donors to transactions
  - Only unmapped transactions are shown in the selection

## Data Structures

### New Types Added to `src/types/student.ts`:

```typescript
export interface Donor {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  amount: number;
  allocated: number;
  unallocated: number;
}

export interface PaymentAllotment {
  id: string;
  studentId: string;
  studentName: string;
  college: string;
  collegeFee: number;
  allottedAmount: number;
  status: 'pending' | 'paid';
  date: string;
  description?: string;
}

export interface Transaction {
  id: string;
  studentId: string;
  studentName: string;
  college: string;
  amount: number;
  date: string;
  status: 'completed' | 'pending' | 'failed';
}

export interface PaymentMapping {
  id: string;
  donorId: string;
  donorName: string;
  transactionId: string;
  studentId: string;
  studentName: string;
  college: string;
  amount: number;
  date: string;
}
```

### Updated Student Interface:
```typescript
export interface Student {
  // ... existing fields ...
  collegeFee?: number; // College fee for the student
  lastAllottedAmount?: number; // Last amount allotted to this student
}
```

## Component Structure

### Main Component: `AdminPaymentAllotment.tsx`

#### Tabs:
1. **Select Students**: Main interface for selecting students and allotting payments
2. **Payment Pending**: View and update payment pending students to paid status
3. **Payment Mapping**: Map donors to transactions

#### Key Functions:
- `loadStudents()`: Fetches students from API and adds mock college fees
- `handleAllotPayment()`: Creates payment allotments and updates student status
- `handleUpdateToPaid()`: Generates transaction IDs and updates status to paid
- `handlePaymentMapping()`: Creates payment mappings between donors and transactions
- `generateTransactionId()`: Creates unique transaction IDs

## User Workflow

### 1. Payment Allotment Process:
1. Admin navigates to "Payment Allotment" page
2. Admin selects students from the "Select Students" tab
3. Admin enters amounts for each selected student (prefilled with last amount)
4. Admin can change status using dropdown if needed
5. Admin clicks "Allot Payment" button
6. System creates payment allotment records
7. Student status updates to "Payment Pending"
8. Students appear in "Payment Pending" tab

### 2. Payment Completion Process:
1. Admin goes to "Payment Pending" tab
2. Admin selects students who have received payment
3. Admin clicks "Update to Paid" button
4. System generates unique transaction IDs for each student
5. Student status updates to "Payment Completed"
6. Transaction records are created
7. Students appear in "Payment Mapping" tab for donor mapping

### 3. Payment Mapping Process:
1. Admin goes to "Payment Mapping" tab
2. Admin selects donors from left panel
3. Admin selects transactions from right panel
4. Admin clicks "Create Mapping" button
5. System creates payment mapping records
6. Donors are linked to transactions for tracking

## Mock Data

The system includes mock data for demonstration:
- **Donors**: 3 mock donors with different allocation amounts
- **Payment Allotments**: 2 mock allotments (1 pending, 1 paid)
- **Transactions**: 1 mock completed transaction
- **Payment Mappings**: 1 mock mapping between donor and transaction

## Status Flow

1. **Interview Scheduled** → **Document Uploaded** → **Waiting for Payment** → **Payment Completed** → **Payment Verified**

2. When payment is allotted: Status changes to **Waiting for Payment**
3. When payment is marked as paid: Status changes to **Payment Completed**
4. Multiple status changes to "Paid" create multiple transaction IDs

## Key Features Summary

✅ **College Fee Display**: Each student shows their college fee amount
✅ **Last Allotted Amount Prefilling**: Amount input is prefilled with last sent amount
✅ **Editable Amount Input**: Admin can modify amounts for each student
✅ **Status Changes Dropdown**: Admin can change status directly from interface
✅ **Payment Pending Status Update**: Selected students status updates to "Payment Pending"
✅ **Transaction ID Generation**: Automatic generation of unique transaction IDs

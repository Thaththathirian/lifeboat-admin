# FedCM Error Troubleshooting Guide

## What is FedCM?

FedCM (Federated Credential Management) is Google's new authentication API that replaces the traditional OAuth flow. The error you're seeing indicates that FedCM has been disabled in your browser.

## Error Message
```
FedCM was disabled either temporarily based on previous user action or permanently via site settings. 
Try manage third-party sign-in via the icon to the left of the URL bar or via site settings.
```

## Solutions

### 1. **Automatic Fallback (Recommended)**
The application now automatically detects FedCM errors and falls back to the traditional Google OAuth flow. When you see this error:

1. The app will show a toast message: "Redirecting to Google OAuth page..."
2. You'll be redirected to Google's OAuth page
3. Sign in with your Google account
4. You'll be redirected back to the application
5. The authentication will complete automatically

### 2. **Browser Settings (If Fallback Doesn't Work)**

#### Chrome/Edge:
1. Click the lock icon in the address bar
2. Click "Site settings"
3. Find "Third-party sign-in" or "Federated Credential Management"
4. Change it to "Allow"
5. Refresh the page

#### Firefox:
1. Go to `about:config`
2. Search for `identity.federated-login`
3. Set it to `true`
4. Restart Firefox

#### Safari:
1. Go to Safari > Preferences > Privacy
2. Uncheck "Prevent cross-site tracking"
3. Refresh the page

### 3. **Alternative Browsers**
If the issue persists, try using:
- **Chrome** (most compatible)
- **Firefox** (good compatibility)
- **Edge** (good compatibility)

### 4. **Incognito/Private Mode**
Try opening the application in incognito/private mode, as this often resolves FedCM issues.

## Technical Details

### Why This Happens
- FedCM is a new API that browsers are gradually adopting
- Some browsers disable it by default for security reasons
- Previous user actions can disable it temporarily
- Site settings can disable it permanently

### How the Fix Works
The application now includes:

1. **FedCM Detection**: Detects when FedCM is disabled
2. **Automatic Fallback**: Switches to traditional OAuth flow
3. **Error Handling**: Provides clear user feedback
4. **Callback Processing**: Handles the OAuth redirect properly

### Code Implementation
```typescript
// Detect FedCM error
if (error.toString().includes('FedCM')) {
  // Redirect to traditional OAuth
  const googleAuthUrl = getGoogleOAuthUrl();
  window.location.href = googleAuthUrl;
}
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. **Test FedCM Error**
1. Disable FedCM in your browser settings
2. Click "Apply Now" button
3. Should see "Redirecting to Google OAuth page..."
4. Should be redirected to Google OAuth page

### 2. **Test OAuth Callback**
1. Complete Google OAuth flow
2. Should be redirected back to application
3. Should see "Login Successful" message
4. Should be redirected to student dashboard

### 3. **Test Normal Flow**
1. Enable FedCM in browser settings
2. Click "Apply Now" button
3. Should see Google OAuth popup
4. Complete authentication normally

## Debug Information

### Console Logs
The application logs detailed information:
- `Google OAuth initialized successfully`
- `FedCM error detected, using fallback`
- `OAuth callback detected, processing...`
- `Backend authentication successful`

### Network Tab
Check for these requests:
- `https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth` (OAuth redirect)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v2/userinfo` (User info fetch)
- `/api/auth/google` (Backend authentication)

## Common Issues

### 1. **OAuth Redirect Not Working**
- Check that your Google OAuth client ID is correct
- Verify the redirect URI is properly configured
- Ensure the domain is authorized in Google Console

### 2. **Backend Connection Failed**
- Check that your backend API is running
- Verify the `/api/auth/google` endpoint exists
- Check CORS configuration

### 3. **User Not Created**
- Check backend logs for user creation errors
- Verify database connection
- Check user creation logic

## Prevention

### 1. **User Education**
- Inform users about the FedCM fallback
- Provide clear instructions for browser settings
- Suggest alternative browsers if needed

### 2. **Monitoring**
- Monitor FedCM error rates
- Track OAuth success rates
- Log authentication flow issues

### 3. **Testing**
- Test with different browsers
- Test with different FedCM settings
- Test with incognito mode

## Support

If you continue to experience issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for error messages
2. **Check Network Tab**: Verify API calls are working
3. **Try Different Browser**: Test with Chrome/Firefox
4. **Contact Support**: Provide error logs and browser details

## Future Improvements

- **Progressive Enhancement**: Use FedCM when available, fallback to OAuth
- **User Preferences**: Remember user's preferred authentication method
- **Analytics**: Track which authentication method users prefer
- **A/B Testing**: Test different authentication flows
